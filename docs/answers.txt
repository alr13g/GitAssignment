(e) Git status displays the state of the working directory and the staging 
area. it lets you see which changes have been staged, which havent, and
which files aren't being tracked by Git. On the other hand, git log displays
committed snapshots. It lets you list the project history, filter it, and
search for specific changes. Git status lets you inspect the working 
directory and staging area but git log only operates on the committed history.
